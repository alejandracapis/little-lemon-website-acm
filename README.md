# Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate: Capstone project
Creating a restaurant app for "Little Lemon Restaurant" customers for my final project in the certificate.
This webpage is still in process but the first part which was developing the whole design and code is already available to visit.
The nexts steps are to create the booking form and give buttons the utility they are meant to have.
I hope you like it!
